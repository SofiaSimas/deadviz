## Deadviz

This is a browser extension for a plan/deadline time visualizer. Visualizer uses boxes as the visualization.
Deadviz will dynamically readjust box count based on the time range (day, week, month and year).
Red box means a passed time box relative to the current time, white box means future time box relative to the current time.
